## What Happens
1. Vercel triggers the cron job daily at 7 AM UTC
2. The function calls `postDailyPlaylists()`
3. Fetches from 3 FS Composer API endpoints
4. Posts playlists that match today's date to the music topic
5. If no playlists available, does nothing (silent)

## Manual Testing
You can manually trigger the cron job by visiting:
`https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/playlist-cron`

## Monitoring
Check Vercel function logs to see:
- When cron job runs
- Whether playlists were found and posted
- Any API errors or issues
